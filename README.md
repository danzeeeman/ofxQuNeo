ofxQuNeo
========

This addon, which depends on ofxMidi, will give you easy access to using your QuNeo controller in openFrameworks while also sending out its values over OSC.

Use the included ofxQuneo.quneopreset to set your controller up to send data on the properly numbered control channels. Currently only works with x/y values, not grid mode, but that could come later if there is a desire for it.

There is also a file for using an Akai MPD24 in a similar fashion.

Todo: Add event handlers for each output
